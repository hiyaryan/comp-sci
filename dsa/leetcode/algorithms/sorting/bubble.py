# Bubble sort

# Elementary sorting algorithms: bubble, insertion, selection

# Bubble sort comes from the idea of "bubbling up", the first value is compared with the second value and swaps places depending on the value comparisons.

# Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm but has one of the worst time complexities on average due to the nested for-loops.

# Complexities: Time (best, average, worst): Î©(n), Î˜(n^2), O(n^2) / Space: O(1)
